# 📡 Voxra API v1 Availability & Overview

Voxra provides a modern, RESTful API (v1) that enables programmatic access to core PBX resources such as domains, extensions, and voicemails. This API is designed for developers, integrators, and service providers who want to automate provisioning, integrate external systems, or build custom dashboards on top of Voxra.

## 🚀 API Availability

- **Status:** Available and documented

---

## 🔗 Base URL

All API endpoints are prefixed with:

```

```

## 🔐 Authentication

Voxra API v1 uses **Bearer token authentication**.

- API tokens are generated within the Voxra web UI (Users section).
- Each request must include an `Authorization` header.

Example:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

> ⚠️ API tokens should be treated like passwords and stored securely.

## 🛠 API Design & Behavior

The Voxra API follows standard REST conventions:

- **HTTP verbs:** `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`
- **Predictable, resource-based URLs**
- **JSON responses**
- **HTTP status codes** for success and errors

### Pagination

List endpoints support pagination to efficiently handle large datasets.

Common parameters include:

- `limit` – number of records to return
- `starting_after` – cursor-based pagination token

This makes the API suitable for automation, reporting, and data synchronization tasks.

---

## 📦 Common Resource Types

While the full endpoint list is defined in the official docs, the API is structured around common PBX resources such as:

- **Domains** – multi-tenant PBX environments
- **Extensions** – SIP users and endpoints
- **Voicemails** – voicemail boxes and messages

Each resource is exposed using consistent REST patterns for listing, querying, and management.

- Automated provisioning of domains and extensions
- Integration with billing, CRM, or OSS/BSS systems
- Custom reporting and analytics dashboards
